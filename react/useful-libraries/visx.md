# Visx

Visx is a collection of React-based data visualization tools developed by Airbnb. Visx, which stands for visualization component, is not a visualization library — rather, it is a collection of primitives or components that can be mixed together to create a custom visualization library based on a project’s requirements.

Though built on the popular D3 visualization library, Visx delegates the DOM manipulation work to the React library. Meanwhile, D3 is mostly used for calculations.

Visx can fit into any React app regardless of the architecture.
