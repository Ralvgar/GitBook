# React testing

## Types of test

**End-to-End**: Spin up your app and simulate user behavior. Kind of like a robot performing a task in your app.

**Integration:** Verify that multiple units work together.

**Unit: Verify** the functionality of a single function/component.

**Static:** Catch typos and errors while writing code.
