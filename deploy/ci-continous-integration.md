# CI \(Continous integration\)

Continuous Integration \(CI\) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

Benefits of integration is that you can detect errors quickly and locate them more easily.
