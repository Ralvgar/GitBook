# Cross browser compatibility

As a web developer, it is your responsibility to make sure that not only do your projects work, but they work for all your users, no matter what browser, device, or additional assistive tools they are using.

Cross browser testing is the practice of making sure that the web sites and web apps you create work across an acceptable number of web browsers.
