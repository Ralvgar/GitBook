# ES

ECMAScript is a Standard for a scripting languages. It is the core that builds JavaScript.

 Languages such as ActionScript, JavaScript, JScript all use ECMAScript as its core. As a comparison, AS/JS/JScript are 3 different cars, but they all use the same engine. 

EcmaScript has different versions, actually ES5 is what is compatible with most of the web browsers, we can make code in newer versions but then we have to compile our code with code compilers like babble.

Since ES5 ECMAScript launches a new version every year with new feathures:

### ES6\(ES2015\): 

 This update adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including class declarations \(`class Foo { ... }`\), ES6 modules like `import * as moduleName from "..."; export const Foo`. Other new features include iterators and `for...of` loops, arrow function expression \(`() => {...}`\), `let` keyword for local declarations, `const` keyword for constant local declarations, binary data, typed arrays, new collections \(maps, sets and WeakMap\), promises, number and math enhancements, reflection, proxies \(metaprogramming for virtual objects and wrappers\) and template literals for strings.
